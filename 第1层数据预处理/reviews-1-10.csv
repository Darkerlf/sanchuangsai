70,9353,B0BFR5K1YF,R28ICBH1OYFRMQ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"INCREDIBLE SET.Let me first start out with, I'm not sure if the block came with a minor scratch or if my wife put it there before I got a chance to inspect in good lighting. I opened it all up in lighting comparable to what you see in my photos and never caught a tiny scratch on the block. The next day with daylight, I noticed it. I don't even care. It's small and maybe I'll color it in with a black paint pen or marker if I care enough. These knives are incredible.So first, like everyone else stated, they're crazy sharp. They're so sharp, my wife doesn't even want to use them. She's a tad clumsy and cut herself on the 12 year old set this replaced. That said, she gave it a shot under my supervision to do some veggie work and she was blown away.The feel and quality of these knives needs to be put in hand to understand. They feel like an artists tool. They got weight to them and a high quality feel. The steel is thicker than my last set and feels stronger. The steel goes from tip to end of handle, FULL TANG. The craftsmanship of the handle and shape of the knives is a beauty. I can't stop putting together dishes just to cut stuff, lol. They feel so good in the hand and just make you want to use them.I finally had a chance to use the ""steak"" knives on a pork dish I put together and it cut through like butter. They're all insanely sharp, so again be careful handling them. I washed all of them right out of the box and didn't realize I nearly sliced my sponge in half when I was done with them.So yeah, I'll just end that I'm more than satisfied with these. Replacing my 12 year old KitchenAid set never felt better. I did a lot of research prior to buying and it was a close call between going German or Japanese (made in Cali), then thought about Hattori Hanzo and how the Bride got her revenge. Japanese steel baby. These do not disappoint and you will not regret the purchase, I promise.EDIT - I want to touch up on folks with the rust problems and possibly put some fears to rest. These are stainless steel. Even the Cybertruck has owners complaining about rust. The best you can do to prevent it is immediately dry them as soon as you wash them and do not let them sit in water. Think about it, if you fear they're just going to rust out of nowhere, you would have potentially received one out of the box covered in rust. That's not how it works. More than likely the folks complaining about rust have either put them in a dish washer (use at your own risk) or let them sit in a pot of water or something and did not immediately dry them.My best advice using these is immediately wash and dry them off as soon as you use them. It's easy enough to accomplish. I see I'm cutting some pork, I pull out the Santoku knife. I use it. I immediately run it under water/soap, grab my cloth hand towel and carefully dry it off, ensuring no water is left on it and put it back in the block. This can probably solve 99% of the rust problems.",5,"December 6, 2025",0,2,MikeBNj,Color: Pure Black,2026-01-10 07:50:02

74,9357,B0FXGVVN4N,R1OWNRO4QIBTXA,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This serrated bread knife solved a common issue in my kitchen: uneven slices and crushed loaves. The 10-inch blade provides enough length to cut through larger breads in one pass. Homemade loaves with thick crusts are no longer a problem. The knife bites into the crust cleanly and glides through the inside without pulling.The steel feels sturdy and well made. There is a sense of control while slicing, even with firm bread fresh out of the oven. The serrated edge stays aligned and cuts evenly across the entire loaf. That makes portions look uniform, which helps when serving guests.Beyond bread, this knife proved useful for cakes and pastries. When slicing a sponge cake, the blade moves through gently, leaving smooth edges. Frosting stays in place, and crumbs are minimal. This made dessert prep feel calmer and more organized.The handle fits comfortably in hand and feels secure during use. Long prep sessions did not cause discomfort. After slicing, cleanup takes little effort. Crumbs rinse away easily, and the blade looks clean without scrubbing.What stood out most was how dependable the knife felt over time. Each use delivered the same clean cuts, whether working with crusty bread or delicate cake layers. It handled everyday kitchen tasks with consistency and strength. This knife meets the needs of home baking and family meals without complications. Worth to buy.",5,"December 18, 2025",0,1,ElenaShow,"",2026-01-10 07:50:02

150,9433,B0F9WMG8VG,R28ICBH1OYFRMQ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"INCREDIBLE SET.Let me first start out with, I'm not sure if the block came with a minor scratch or if my wife put it there before I got a chance to inspect in good lighting. I opened it all up in lighting comparable to what you see in my photos and never caught a tiny scratch on the block. The next day with daylight, I noticed it. I don't even care. It's small and maybe I'll color it in with a black paint pen or marker if I care enough. These knives are incredible.So first, like everyone else stated, they're crazy sharp. They're so sharp, my wife doesn't even want to use them. She's a tad clumsy and cut herself on the 12 year old set this replaced. That said, she gave it a shot under my supervision to do some veggie work and she was blown away.The feel and quality of these knives needs to be put in hand to understand. They feel like an artists tool. They got weight to them and a high quality feel. The steel is thicker than my last set and feels stronger. The steel goes from tip to end of handle, FULL TANG. The craftsmanship of the handle and shape of the knives is a beauty. I can't stop putting together dishes just to cut stuff, lol. They feel so good in the hand and just make you want to use them.I finally had a chance to use the ""steak"" knives on a pork dish I put together and it cut through like butter. They're all insanely sharp, so again be careful handling them. I washed all of them right out of the box and didn't realize I nearly sliced my sponge in half when I was done with them.So yeah, I'll just end that I'm more than satisfied with these. Replacing my 12 year old KitchenAid set never felt better. I did a lot of research prior to buying and it was a close call between going German or Japanese (made in Cali), then thought about Hattori Hanzo and how the Bride got her revenge. Japanese steel baby. These do not disappoint and you will not regret the purchase, I promise.EDIT - I want to touch up on folks with the rust problems and possibly put some fears to rest. These are stainless steel. Even the Cybertruck has owners complaining about rust. The best you can do to prevent it is immediately dry them as soon as you wash them and do not let them sit in water. Think about it, if you fear they're just going to rust out of nowhere, you would have potentially received one out of the box covered in rust. That's not how it works. More than likely the folks complaining about rust have either put them in a dish washer (use at your own risk) or let them sit in a pot of water or something and did not immediately dry them.My best advice using these is immediately wash and dry them off as soon as you use them. It's easy enough to accomplish. I see I'm cutting some pork, I pull out the Santoku knife. I use it. I immediately run it under water/soap, grab my cloth hand towel and carefully dry it off, ensuring no water is left on it and put it back in the block. This can probably solve 99% of the rust problems.",5,"December 6, 2025",0,2,MikeBNj,Color: Pure Black,2026-01-10 07:50:02

154,9437,B0F9XVDV1M,R1OWNRO4QIBTXA,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This serrated bread knife solved a common issue in my kitchen: uneven slices and crushed loaves. The 10-inch blade provides enough length to cut through larger breads in one pass. Homemade loaves with thick crusts are no longer a problem. The knife bites into the crust cleanly and glides through the inside without pulling.The steel feels sturdy and well made. There is a sense of control while slicing, even with firm bread fresh out of the oven. The serrated edge stays aligned and cuts evenly across the entire loaf. That makes portions look uniform, which helps when serving guests.Beyond bread, this knife proved useful for cakes and pastries. When slicing a sponge cake, the blade moves through gently, leaving smooth edges. Frosting stays in place, and crumbs are minimal. This made dessert prep feel calmer and more organized.The handle fits comfortably in hand and feels secure during use. Long prep sessions did not cause discomfort. After slicing, cleanup takes little effort. Crumbs rinse away easily, and the blade looks clean without scrubbing.What stood out most was how dependable the knife felt over time. Each use delivered the same clean cuts, whether working with crusty bread or delicate cake layers. It handled everyday kitchen tasks with consistency and strength. This knife meets the needs of home baking and family meals without complications. Worth to buy.",5,"December 18, 2025",0,1,ElenaShow,"",2026-01-10 07:50:02

376,9659,B0F3KWZQ61,R1ZV62PU547B8X,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After looking at some of the other reviews, I was somewhat taken aback. Those that included photos were not the set I received, so apparently they sell different versions. To be clear, I’ve included a photo of what I received.The knives have a Damascus steel look to them. Note that this is not actual “pattern welded” Damascus steel, but rather finished (probably laser finished) to give that appearance. This is not uncommon, of little consequence, and the seller does not claim it to be anything other than a Damascus finish. I was very impressed with the packaging of the set, and it would present itself well as a gift. The weight and balance of the set is remarkable, and the sharpness is downright scary. I love the look of the magnetic holder, as it lets you show off the set. The magnet is strong, but the knives release with a simple twist. I’ve owned the set for about six weeks now, and so far, have nothing but good things to say about them. They're still sharp, and zero signs of corrossion. Do be aware that one of the reasons these are so sharp is that, like many fine knives, the bevels are ground to a 17-degree angle, compared to a more typical 20+ degree angle. The steeper the angle, the sharper, but more delicate the edge can be. In the end, it’s a tradeoff, but handle them gently, and I suspect they will serve you well. I intend to report back if this set does not live up to its price point, but so far, I’m impressed.",5,"December 29, 2025",0,0,Bonwit,"",2026-01-10 07:50:02

I picked up this three-piece Japanese-style set, mostly because I liked the hand-forged look of the high-carbon steel. I’m giving this set five stars because of the sheer cutting performance and feel in my hand. They are a genuinely solid addition to the kitchen arsenal.What I really like is the weight and balance of these tools, especially that large butcher knife. It has a great heft to it, which is exactly what I want when breaking down a pork shoulder or thick cut of beef. The boning knife is agile and holds an edge beautifully. The carbon steel is incredibly sharp right out of the box, and it feels like a real, traditional piece of equipment, not some mass-produced stainless steel that dulls if you look at it wrong. The included honing rod is decent, and so far, a quick run over it keeps the blades razor-sharp.The biggest dislike, and you need to know this upfront, is the maintenance. Because it’s high-carbon steel, it’s not forgiving. If you leave these knives wet for five minutes, they’ll start to show rust spots. I have to make sure they are washed and dried immediately after every single use, or you pay the price. My wife is pretty good about it, but with two kids—my 11 and 13-year-old daughters—it's a constant battle to make sure they don't get tossed in the sink. But really, that's the trade-off for this kind of sharp, tough steel. Given the quality of the blades and how well they perform for breaking down meat and handling heavy-duty kitchen tasks, the value for the money is excellent, even with the required extra care.",5,"December 3, 2025",0,0,ThomasM,Number of Items: 3,2026-01-10 07:50:02

614,9897,B0FRM53T6N,R32DD57CM15E1D,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This review is for the following item: HOSHANHO 8 Inch Chef Knife, 9 Layers 10CR15MOV High Carbon Steel Kitchen Knife, Japanese Professional Gyuto Chefs Knives with Octagonal Rosewood Handle. It cost $75.99 when I ordered it.This 8-inch Japanese chef’s knife has become part of my regular kitchen rotation. It replaced a western style chef knife I had been using for more than 40 years, and that says a lot. I was comfortable with my old knife, but this one is clearly an upgrade.Over time I have learned that Japanese style knives just work better for me. The blade profile sits flatter on the cutting board, so there is less rocking from tip to heel when I am prepping food. That flatter feel makes slicing and chopping feel more controlled and natural.The edge was razor sharp right out of the box and only needed a quick pass on a steel before its first use. I used it heavily for slicing, chopping, and general prep during the first week, and after that my old chef’s knife stayed in the drawer. The edge held up very well and only needed light steeling to stay sharp. After about three weeks of regular use, I touched it up on a 2000 grit ceramic whetstone and it was right back to day one sharpness.I also really like the octagonal Japanese style handle. It may not feel quite as planted as a big western handle when cutting very large or firm items, but for vegetable prep and everyday kitchen work it is noticeably more comfortable. That kind of prep probably makes up most of my time in the kitchen anyway.Visually, this knife looks great too. The blade texture and layered pattern stand out, and the rosewood handle with the brass stud gives it a refined look. It definitely feels and looks different from my western knives in a good way. Overall, this has been a very satisfying switch.",5,"December 28, 2025",0,1,AverageConsumerFam,Color: 8 Inch Chef Knife,2026-01-10 07:50:02

Unfortunately, after just over a week of normal household use, the quality issues became impossible to ignore.  Any contact with moisture causes the knives to rust extremely quickly, even with regular washing and drying. Additionally, one of the knives chipped while using the included knife honer, which should not happen with proper steel. These knives are advertised as carbon stainless steel with a stated retail value of $400+, but there is no $400 knife set that should rust or chip under normal use.  The set is often “on sale” for around $200, which now feels much closer to its true value—if not still overpriced. I’ve also reached out to customer support via email and have not received a response after over a week.  While the knives look great out of the box, the durability and materials do not match the premium branding or price point.

Next use was on smoked brisket on New Years Day. I must say, I am truly impressed. Again, thin cuts was easy. I carved though the flat like butter.

The design of the blade with a cool wood/epoxy handle is very well done and evenly balanced. It feels great in your hand while chopping and slicing. The addition of high carbon in the stainless steel and the 12 degree edge angle makes the blade very durable and sharp as well as rust resistant. It came out of the box razor sharp. One thing to be aware of is that ""pakkawood"" is not a solid wood species. The handle is made laminating sheets of real wood veneer and then gluing them together with a resin. This actually makes the handle less porous and harder than if it was a solid piece of wood...that's a good thing. Also, be aware that the blade is not a true Damascus steel blade. It is just laser etched with a pattern to look like it. I don't mind as it's still a very quality blade and still looks cool.
