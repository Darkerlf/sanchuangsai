First use was on prime rib on Christmas Day. Carved through the beef as thin or as thick as I wanted to cut. I was almost disappointed when I was done carving the roast. Next use was on smoked brisket on New Years Day. I must say, I am truly impressed. Again, thin cuts was easy. I carved though the flat like butter. I cubed the point for burnt ends and it was such an easy task. I fully expected this from this knife.

Right out of the box, the quality is obvious. The stainless steel knives look sleek and modern, and the wooden block adds a warm, professional touch that fits perfectly with my kitchen décor. It looks clean and stylish without being too flashy.The knives are well-balanced and feel solid in the hand. I really like the contoured handles—they’re comfortable to grip and make prep work feel easier and smoother. So far, they’ve cut everything with ease, from slicing vegetables to trimming meats. I also love the built-in sharpener in the block. It’s such a smart, space-saving feature that helps keep the blades sharp without needing to buy a separate tool.That said, I ran into one big issue. I accidentally left one of the knives in the sink overnight, and by morning it had rusted significantly. Not only did the blade rust, but it also left a large rust stain in my sink. That was really disappointing, especially since I assumed stainless steel would be more resistant. I now make sure to dry each knife immediately after washing and never leave them wet or in the sink.Overall, this set has been a great upgrade in terms of both looks and performance. Just be cautious about keeping them dry—these definitely require some care.

141,13427,B00N9HWFLS,R3QHC3ZIVO15BI,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I stumbled across these knives while on vacation when the AirBnB we were staying at had a set in the kitchen.  I liked them so much that I looked them up and ordered a set for myself as soon as I came home.  That was in March 2019.They felt great in hand and actually made cooking more enjoyable because they performed so well.  We have used them almost daily for the past 7 years and have been BRUTAL on them.  They’ve been dropped; left soaking in liquids for long periods of time; thrown around in the sink; smashed with heavy pans while in the sink; ran through the dishwasher a million times; etc. They have never been sharpened and are only slightly less sharp than when we first purchased them.  They are still very usable.The attached photos show the wear and tear as of today (1/8/26), nearly 7 years after purchase - both front and back. The purple chef’s knife is the most used knife in the kitchen, hands down.  While there has been definite wearing of the coating within the last year or two, the handles still look like the day I bought them.  Everything is tight and there is zero rust (even after sitting in the dishwasher or water for long periods).  Tips are still in tact.  You can’t possibly ask for better performance from a set of $30 knives.  These have outperformed more expensive knives I’ve owned by a mile!I’ve purchased multiple sets as gifts and I’m about to purchase a second set for a new home but my originals 100% still get the job done.

The color coding is a wonderful feature that not only looks fun, but also helps prevent cross-contamination while cooking. Each knife is lightweight and easy to handle, making food preparation much more efficient. I particularly appreciate the varying sizes and shapes of the knives, which accommodate a range of cutting tracks, from slicing vegetables to carving meat. The blades are sharp and have held their edge relatively well, though I do find that they require regular honing to maintain their performance. The handles are comfortable, but I wish they had a bit more grip for added safety., especially when cutting tougher ingredients. The only reason I didn’t give it a full five stars is that I would have preferred a more durable material for the blades. They are good for everyday use,.

The block is nearly straight up and down.. so when I try to pull out a larger knife the handle hits the cabinet and I can't get it out with out tilting the block or moving the whole block forward.

The handle is well-made and comfortable, the knife is weighted and balanced well to enable good control. This is a sizable blade (as expected for the style) so it needs a “cleaver” spot in the block - keep this in mind.Now, the bad…the first knife arrives with chips in the blade. It’s shrink-wrapped so there wasn’t any pre-use - my suspicion is that the chips happened in transit. So, I returned the first one and awaited the second. The chips were far worse in the second. I would have had to grind off way more metal than should ever be expected on a ready-to-use knife. I kept the first one because I got it on a special deal, and the chips were small enough for me to grind out in a few passes on the whetstone. To that end - I can’t really say if it was sharp out of the box, but it sure was after I worked on it. Definitely returning the one with larger chips, and given that 2/2 of the ones I got were damaged, I’m guessing it’s happening a lot.

The etching also makes it look cheap which again is just me being picky. When I put it in my hand it immediately felt unpleasant not only is it very heavy but not very well balanced, it feels like I’m holding it too tight just to keep it from falling out of my hands, I felt the edge and it was fairly sharp but not as good as my personal knives which is to be expected from a factory. After first impressions I did a couple tests chopping an onion, tomato and chicken. The knife did about as well as expected on the chicken but under preformed on chopping the onion and tomato, I count the blade was sharp enough to cut the meat and onions if you were chopping straight down but due to the thickness of the blades well as the etching It tended to get caught up in whatever I was cutting. I also found often my knuckles hitting the cutting board before or during chopping I wish the blade was just a bit wider or the handle was positioned higher to avoid this issue. And finally and in my opinion the most detrimental part to the design was the handle. I found it somewhat uncomfortable for a few different reasons the first being the finish it’s gloss which is good for cleaning but not so good for handling it felt as though it was going to turn or slip in my hand when I was cutting especially when cutting the chicken. The other thing that contributes to the death grip I had on it was the fact it’s slightly too circular. That all said for the 41$ price tag it does come with a decent bit of things and if you’re not too keen on hand sharpening knives like myself the sharpener it comes with is fairly decent. The guard it comes with is low quality but a nice add on none the less. The packaging is high quality and although the. Finger guard it’s goofy it’s something,And I wish I could say it was a better knife over all. I’d say it’s worth the price tag if you’re looking for a meh knife with few add ons.I’ll most likely be getting a different knife for my family but if this is what you’re set on it’s  a lot of personal preference",3,"June 29, 2025",0,0,Evan Coe,Style: 8 inch chef knife,2026-01-16 02:41:34,""

I sharpened this new knife with the provided sharpener and it does nothing for it. I used the sharpener to revive my old cheap ones though and they now work better than this crappy knife does! But I could have just bought a knife sharpener if that's what I actually wanted to happen. I threw away the box this came in so even if I could return it, I can't now. I'm out way too much for one of the worst knives I've ever owned. I'll stick to buying ones that cost way less than this one does and just sharpen them.Original review only after first use:This is definitely better that my cheap knives but definitely not worth paying as much as I did for this. It literally lost how sharp it was half way through cutting a bunch of raw chicken breast for batch cooking. I had to wash it and sharpen it to finish cutting up in chunks. In sharpening it with their provided sharpener, gently, small chips happened on the blade. I'm going to keep it and not return it because it's so better than what I have and really need a better knife.

It was truly quite stunning! However, after about two weeks of using them, I started noticing the color beginning to fade a bit. I keep things simple when cleaning—just soap and water, and a cloth—since I’ve found that using sponges or anything rough can scratch off the color.It’s been over a month now, and I’m happy to say the knives still hold their sharpness surprisingly well since I use them daily. The little holder it comes with fits perfectly in a corner of my RV’s small stove area, which is super convenient.Overall, I’d probably give it four stars instead of five because of the color fading and scratching over time, but if you're looking for a durable, nice-looking knife set, I’d definitely recommend giving it a try!",4,"July 19, 2025",1,3,Hailey,Color: H-Rainbow Blade/Acrylic BlockSize: 14-Piece,2026-01-16 02:46:30,""

The cheap steel has a limit on how sharp they can be sharpened, and they don't hold the edge very long, before needing resharpened. The scissors are pretty cheap. The handles are hollow, so they have to be dried almost vertically, or you'll get water dripping when you put them in the block. A couple handles have dents, possibly from dishes being set on them in the sink? I have only recently started trying them in the dishwasher, so far, no issues.
