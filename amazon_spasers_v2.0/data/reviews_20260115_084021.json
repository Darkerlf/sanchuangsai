That said, once I was able to out a decent edge back on them, these knives have served me very well for years. With a quick hone every few uses, these knives have maintained a pretty impressive edge for a cheap set. They no longer are dishwasher safe as they have started to get small rust spots if run through the dishwasher. However, seeing as they've made it 7 years already, I'm happy to hand wash them.",

The whole point of new knives is that my old set is 30 years old and beyond sharpening at this point.2 - I didn't think about this when I ordered this, but the angle of the block isn't good for me. I keep them on the counter and I have cabinets above. The block is nearly straight up and down.. so when I try to pull out a larger knife the handle hits the cabinet and I can't get it out with out tilting the block or moving the whole block forward. My old block didn't have as many knives, but it was tilted at a sharper angle so I could just pull the knives forward and out not up and out. The block will be fine if you have nothing close above it, but it won't work for me.",

More importantly, they’re super sharp, durable, and cut through everything with ease. I love that each knife comes with its own cover for safe storage, and they’re dishwasher safe, which makes cleanup so easy. The handles are comfortable, and the quality feels premium for the price. Perfect for everyday use or as a gift. Highly recommened.",

But this knife honestly just feels great to work with. It's also really versatile; the blade size and shape make it easy to mince/chop/dice, scoop up your freshly cut food, and smashing garlic (haven't tried smashing any spices yet).If you're looking for a well rounded/jack of all trades chef knife, this is the one to get!",

However, when I do, I typically hand wash, clean, and dry it shortly after.  I really like the construction and durability of this knife, but if they're going to rust so quickly, I can't really use them.",

Carved through the beef as thin or as thick as I wanted to cut. I was almost disappointed when I was done carving the roast. Next use was on smoked brisket on New Years Day. I must say, I am truly impressed. Again, thin cuts was easy. I carved though the flat like butter. I cubed the point for burnt ends and it was such an easy task. I fully expected this from this knife. I am so glad I got it",

The knives are beautifully crafted with a sleek, modern design that looks great on my kitchen counter. But more importantly — they perform exceptionally well.Each knife is razor-sharp right out of the box and slices through meats, veggies, and bread effortlessly. I especially love the chef’s knife — it’s perfectly balanced and feels great in the hand, making prep work a breeze. The handles are ergonomic and comfortable, even during longer cooking sessions.The set includes all the essentials, and the storage block keeps everything organized and within reach. I've noticed no dulling after weeks of daily use, and they're super easy to clean too.If you're looking for a dependable, stylish, and professional-quality knife set without breaking the bank, this is the one. I highly recommend it to home cooks and pros alike. You won’t be disappointed!",

    "content": "I recently upgraded from a basic budget knife set, and the Chicago Cutlery Malden collection has been a huge step up. Right out of the box, the quality is obvious. The stainless steel knives look sleek and modern, and the wooden block adds a warm, professional touch that fits perfectly with my kitchen décor. It looks clean and stylish without being too flashy.The knives are well-balanced and feel solid in the hand. I really like the contoured handles—they’re comfortable to grip and make prep work feel easier and smoother. So far, they’ve cut everything with ease, from slicing vegetables to trimming meats. I also love the built-in sharpener in the block. It’s such a smart, space-saving feature that helps keep the blades sharp without needing to buy a separate tool.That said, I ran into one big issue. I accidentally left one of the knives in the sink overnight, and by morning it had rusted significantly. Not only did the blade rust, but it also left a large rust stain in my sink. That was really disappointing, especially since I assumed stainless steel would be more resistant. I now make sure to dry each knife immediately after washing and never leave them wet or in the sink.Overall, this set has been a great upgrade in terms of both looks and performance. Just be cautious about keeping them dry—these definitely require some care. Still, for the price and functionality, I’d recommend them if you’re looking for a solid, attractive knife set.",

    "content": "I stumbled across these knives while on vacation when the AirBnB we were staying at had a set in the kitchen.  I liked them so much that I looked them up and ordered a set for myself as soon as I came home.  That was in March 2019.They felt great in hand and actually made cooking more enjoyable because they performed so well.  We have used them almost daily for the past 7 years and have been BRUTAL on them.  They’ve been dropped; left soaking in liquids for long periods of time; thrown around in the sink; smashed with heavy pans while in the sink; ran through the dishwasher a million times; etc. They have never been sharpened and are only slightly less sharp than when we first purchased them.  They are still very usable.The attached photos show the wear and tear as of today (1/8/26), nearly 7 years after purchase - both front and back. The purple chef’s knife is the most used knife in the kitchen, hands down.  While there has been definite wearing of the coating within the last year or two, the handles still look like the day I bought them.  Everything is tight and there is zero rust (even after sitting in the dishwasher or water for long periods).  Tips are still in tact.  You can’t possibly ask for better performance from a set of $30 knives.  These have outperformed more expensive knives I’ve owned by a mile!I’ve purchased multiple sets as gifts and I’m about to purchase a second set for a new home but my originals 100% still get the job done.  I couldn’t be happier with the quality of these knives.",

All the knives are very sharp and feel comfortable on the hand. So as far as ergonomics, they behave well, feel the right weight and seem balanced.Also, having a sharpener right on the wood holding block is essential to keeping the knives sharp down the line.I've had many other knife sets even from great companies like Henckels, but these seem like they would hold up better. Only time will tell of course, but from my initial assessment, they look well made and I'm looking forward to many years of use.Definitely worth the price and then some.",

They're plastic-handled and light. I'll spend $20 more for metal knives that actually feel nice to use.Everybody saying, \"Wow, they're so sharp!\"--folks, all cheap knives are sharp when you first get them. Then they get dull, quickly.Would not recommend. Astercook, all you had to do was send me a new knife block. Pathetic.",

    "content": "I am extremely impressed with this 16-Piece Kitchen Knife Set with Block. From the moment I opened the box, the quality and presentation stood out. The natural wenge wood block looks beautiful on the countertop and gives the kitchen a high-end, professional feel. It’s sturdy, well-finished, and holds each knife securely in place.The knives themselves are outstanding. Made from high carbon German steel, they are incredibly sharp right out of the box and slice through everything with ease, vegetables, meat, bread, and even delicate herbs. The balance and weight of each knife feel perfect in hand, making long prep sessions much more comfortable and precise. The ergonomic handles provide a secure, non-slip grip, which adds confidence and safety while cutting.I also really appreciate the variety in this 16-piece set. It covers every need in the kitchen, from chef’s and slicing knives to utility and paring knives, plus the kitchen shears. The built-in sharpener is a fantastic bonus, allowing me to keep the blades in top condition without needing extra tools.Overall, this knife set delivers exceptional performance, durability, and style. It looks elegant, performs like professional-grade cutlery, and offers great value for the price. I highly recommend this set to anyone looking to upgrade their kitchen with a reliable, sharp, and beautiful knife collection.",

On top of all that the handles are actually a dull rough plastic and not smooth and shiny as shown in the picture. This is not quality that’s justifies the price.",

I purchased due to the Damascus aspect hoping they'll hold their edge a bit longer than normal. Only reason for the 4 vs 5 star is that they should have come with a wood block so we can keep them on the counter. Otherwise they are great knives. Look great, very sharp and with any luck, she won't turn them into jagged trash. I will be purchasing a very good sharpening tool to keep them up.",

    "content": "First, the packaging is impressive- the box has a magnetic lid and the cleaveris secured in a velvet enclosure.  The cleaver itself is real steel with a good weight to it and a lightly oiled.  It’s razor sharp so be careful!  Feels good in the hand, cuts through chicken breast like it’s air.  Also looks great on my magnetic knife rack that I built.  Can’t wait to use this for my BBQ’s!  I would expect a cleaver of this quality to cost a lot more.  Very happy with this purchase.",

    "content": "I can only assume this German high-carbon steel began life as the remnants of a pre–World War II submarine prototype, later recovered through some clever global recycling program and reborn by master Chinese builders into this formidable tool.The full-tang handle, balance, and density are impeccable—this cleaver feels less like a kitchen knife and more like a purpose-built instrument. It sits perfectly in the hand, inspires confidence on the cutting board, and looks absolutely striking while doing it. Fit and finish are outstanding, especially at a price point that feels almost unbelievable for what you’re getting.Serious performance, serious aesthetics, and zero gimmicks. Hats off to everyone involved in bringing this knife to life—including the Amazon delivery hero who had it waiting at my door by sundown.Highly recommended.",
