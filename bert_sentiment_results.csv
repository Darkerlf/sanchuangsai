R1M8G5F5LYV4AM,I got this as a gift for xmas so I can't return it. I am not happy with it though. The knives are fine. The knife block is horrible. It doesn't even look navy like the picture.

The cheap steel has a limit on how sharp they can be sharpened, and they don't hold the edge very long, before needing resharpened. The scissors are pretty cheap. The handles are hollow, so they have to be dried almost vertically, or you'll get water dripping when you put them in the block. A couple handles have dents, possibly from dishes being set on them in the sink? I have only recently started trying them in the dishwasher, so far, no issues. They're holding up ok, with no sign of rust or spotting. I gave my daughter my much old, much larger set of ""decent"" Farberwear knives when I ordered these.

R3665J7UHR7YA6,"I got this set to match my silverware, and when it first arrived, I was really happy with how great everything looked. It was truly quite stunning! However, after about two weeks of using them, I started noticing the color beginning to fade a bit. I keep things simple when cleaning—just soap and water, and a cloth—since I’ve found that using sponges or anything rough can scratch off the color.It’s been over a month now, and I’m happy to say the knives still hold their sharpness surprisingly well since I use them daily. The little holder it comes with fits perfectly in a corner of my RV’s small stove area, which is super convenient.Overall, I’d probably give it four stars instead of five because of the color fading and scratching over time, but if you're looking for a durable, nice-looking knife set, I’d definitely recommend giving it a try!",4,POSITIVE,0.9992702603340149

My first set and the ones I use daily are several years old and I have many more years to look forward to using them. The are beautiful in my opinion. Use safety with the knives as well as the scissors. The downside to everything you buy is if you don't take care of them with pride you will be disappointed.

The entire set of knives is very sturdy and well made, the blades are very sharp, and each knife comes with its own safety cover to keep you protected from any accidents when taking them from drawer to cutting board for use. I prefer the individual knives to a block, as I don't like the extra counter space a block set requires. I ordered the black six piece set and I find them to be very stylish and professional looking. They are a solid set of kitchen chef knives, especially at the great price, and the set has every knife you'd need for your meal preparation.

As you can see, the blade is not a full tang knife and is not held in with any kind of epoxy or anything. It appears the blade is made to a specific design and the handle is pressed around it.

RQDS2L5QXUOMA,"Edit after only a few weeks of use:It now cuts WORSE than my cheap old knives that I was trying to replace with someone a little nicer. I sharpened this new knife with the provided sharpener and it does nothing for it. I used the sharpener to revive my old cheap ones though and they now work better than this crappy knife does! But I could have just bought a knife sharpener if that's what I actually wanted to happen. I threw away the box this came in so even if I could return it, I can't now. I'm out way too much for one of the worst knives I've ever owned. I'll stick to buying ones that cost way less than this one does and just sharpen them.Original review only after first use:This is definitely better that my cheap knives but definitely not worth paying as much as I did for this. It literally lost how sharp it was half way through cutting a bunch of raw chicken breast for batch cooking. I had to wash it and sharpen it to finish cutting up in chunks. In sharpening it with their provided sharpener, gently, small chips happened on the blade. I'm going to keep it and not return it because it's so better than what I have and really need a better knife.

R2S8GSSEEGLP4J,"I struggled with this rating because I like the knife. The knife itself is of good quality - it functions well and as a nakiri should. The handle is well-made and comfortable, the knife is weighted and balanced well to enable good control. This is a sizable blade (as expected for the style) so it needs a “cleaver” spot in the block - keep this in mind.Now, the bad…the first knife arrives with chips in the blade. It’s shrink-wrapped so there wasn’t any pre-use - my suspicion is that the chips happened in transit. So, I returned the first one and awaited the second. The chips were far worse in the second. I would have had to grind off way more metal than should ever be expected on a ready-to-use knife. I kept the first one because I got it on a special deal, and the chips were small enough for me to grind out in a few passes on the whetstone. To that end - I can’t really say if it was sharp out of the box, but it sure was after I worked on it. Definitely returning the one with larger chips, and given that 2/2 of the ones I got were damaged, I’m guessing it’s happening a lot. I feel bad for anyone who gets this and doesn’t have sharpening skills!",2,POSITIVE,0.5927979350090027

R21GK49XFELJFI,"My mom bought this knife for our family but didn’t ask what we thought of it before buying it it was a good sentiment but when I opened it before I even put it in my hand I saw a few problems with it.the first problem I had with it is the fake Damascus etching this is a personal problem I have and it mostly just visual but it also does effect the longevity of the blade. The etching also makes it look cheap which again is just me being picky. When I put it in my hand it immediately felt unpleasant not only is it very heavy but not very well balanced, it feels like I’m holding it too tight just to keep it from falling out of my hands, I felt the edge and it was fairly sharp but not as good as my personal knives which is to be expected from a factory. After first impressions I did a couple tests chopping an onion, tomato and chicken. The knife did about as well as expected on the chicken but under preformed on chopping the onion and tomato, I count the blade was sharp enough to cut the meat and onions if you were chopping straight down but due to the thickness of the blades well as the etching It tended to get caught up in whatever I was cutting. I also found often my knuckles hitting the cutting board before or during chopping I wish the blade was just a bit wider or the handle was positioned higher to avoid this issue. And finally and in my opinion the most detrimental part to the design was the handle. I found it somewhat uncomfortable for a few different reasons the first being the finish it’s gloss which is good for cleaning but not so good for handling it felt as though it was going to turn or slip in my hand when I was cutting especially when cutting the chicken. The other thing that contributes to the death grip I had on it was the fact it’s slightly too circular. That all said for the 41$ price tag it does come with a decent bit of things and if you’re not too keen on hand sharpening knives like myself the sharpener it comes with is fairly decent. The guard it comes with is low quality but a nice add on none the less. The packaging is high quality and although the. Finger guard it’s goofy it’s something,And I wish I could say it was a better knife over all. I’d say it’s worth the price tag if you’re looking for a meh knife with few add ons.I’ll most likely be getting a different knife for my family but if this is what you’re set on it’s a lot of personal preference",3,NEGATIVE,0.9974198341369629

The only slight beef I have is the block is quite small which makes the knives sit almost perpendicular to the countertop so there isn't enough clearance to pull the larger knives out from under the upper cabinets. You have to slide them out from under the upper cabinets or store them somewhere else. Otherwise lovely,5,POSITIVE,0.9540804028511047

When I try to pull out the long knifes they bump into the cabinet above, and I have to move the block to get them out. If the angle was less (like my old block) the knives would just come out.

Higher end knives like the Zwilling Pro are thicker and tapered to help avoid this injury. I ended up using a hand grinder to dull out this point and it's better now.Also note that the blade is a single thin piece of metal throughout the handle, which has a cheaper feel compared to more expensive brands where the metal becomes thicker near your fingers.Lastly, the tip on one of the knives had a tiny shard that was bent to the side, likely a manufacturing defect. You couldn't see it with your eye, but if you dried off the knife with a towel it would ""hook"" the towel and tear out a thread from it. It would likely cut your finger as well.

The color coding is a wonderful feature that not only looks fun, but also helps prevent cross-contamination while cooking. Each knife is lightweight and easy to handle, making food preparation much more efficient. I particularly appreciate the varying sizes and shapes of the knives, which accommodate a range of cutting tracks, from slicing vegetables to carving meat. The blades are sharp and have held their edge relatively well, though I do find that they require regular honing to maintain their performance. The handles are comfortable, but I wish they had a bit more grip for added safety., especially when cutting tougher ingredients. The only reason I didn’t give it a full five stars is that I would have preferred a more durable material for the blades. They are good for everyday use,. But I’m concerned about longevity with high-volume cooking. These offer an affordable price and is perfect for home cooks.

R1K0BMRB3BV187,These knives are far from being anything described in the description or reviews. I purchased them for a Christmas gift for my daughter when they were on sale ( 54% off the original price of $125.99 ) in October '25 based on said reviews. Apparently the reviews were comparing the sharpness to that of a butter knife. My daughter stated that they were very dull. Sad to say she is now stuck with a useless gift since it beyond the return period. The reason I gave ( 1 ) star was based on their looks only !,1,NEGATIVE,0.9995983242988586

Weight is comfortable, not too light nor too heavy. Sharpness of the blades are adequate and work well. Set has a nice variety, harder to find a set with a carving knife which this one has. Storage capacity of course is perfect since the block was made for the set. There will be no problem with handle cracking or rivet issues since they are one solid piece.

R2F2OSZLKFB06D,"I recently upgraded from a basic budget knife set, and the Chicago Cutlery Malden collection has been a huge step up. Right out of the box, the quality is obvious. The stainless steel knives look sleek and modern, and the wooden block adds a warm, professional touch that fits perfectly with my kitchen décor. It looks clean and stylish without being too flashy.The knives are well-balanced and feel solid in the hand. I really like the contoured handles—they’re comfortable to grip and make prep work feel easier and smoother. So far, they’ve cut everything with ease, from slicing vegetables to trimming meats. I also love the built-in sharpener in the block. It’s such a smart, space-saving feature that helps keep the blades sharp without needing to buy a separate tool.That said, I ran into one big issue. I accidentally left one of the knives in the sink overnight, and by morning it had rusted significantly. Not only did the blade rust, but it also left a large rust stain in my sink. That was really disappointing, especially since I assumed stainless steel would be more resistant. I now make sure to dry each knife immediately after washing and never leave them wet or in the sink.Overall, this set has been a great upgrade in terms of both looks and performance. Just be cautious about keeping them dry—these definitely require some care.

They’ve been dropped; left soaking in liquids for long periods of time; thrown around in the sink; smashed with heavy pans while in the sink; ran through the dishwasher a million times; etc. They have never been sharpened and are only slightly less sharp than when we first purchased them. They are still very usable.The attached photos show the wear and tear as of today (1/8/26), nearly 7 years after purchase - both front and back. The purple chef’s knife is the most used knife in the kitchen, hands down. While there has been definite wearing of the coating within the last year or two, the handles still look like the day I bought them. Everything is tight and there is zero rust (even after sitting in the dishwasher or water for long periods). Tips are still in tact. You can’t possibly ask for better performance from a set of $30 knives. These have outperformed more expensive knives I’ve owned by a mile!I’ve purchased multiple sets as gifts and I’m about to purchase a second set for a new home but my originals 100% still get the job done. I couldn’t be happier with the quality of these knives.",5,POSITIVE,0.9967449903488159

It sits perfectly in the hand, inspires confidence on the cutting board, and looks absolutely striking while doing it. Fit and finish are outstanding, especially at a price point that feels almost unbelievable for what you’re getting.Serious performance, serious aesthetics, and zero gimmicks.

R32DD57CM15E1D,"This review is for the following item: HOSHANHO 8 Inch Chef Knife, 9 Layers 10CR15MOV High Carbon Steel Kitchen Knife, Japanese Professional Gyuto Chefs Knives with Octagonal Rosewood Handle. It cost $75.99 when I ordered it.This 8-inch Japanese chef’s knife has become part of my regular kitchen rotation. It replaced a western style chef knife I had been using for more than 40 years, and that says a lot. I was comfortable with my old knife, but this one is clearly an upgrade.Over time I have learned that Japanese style knives just work better for me. The blade profile sits flatter on the cutting board, so there is less rocking from tip to heel when I am prepping food. That flatter feel makes slicing and chopping feel more controlled and natural.The edge was razor sharp right out of the box and only needed a quick pass on a steel before its first use. I used it heavily for slicing, chopping, and general prep during the first week, and after that my old chef’s knife stayed in the drawer. The edge held up very well and only needed light steeling to stay sharp. After about three weeks of regular use, I touched it up on a 2000 grit ceramic whetstone and it was right back to day one sharpness.I also really like the octagonal Japanese style handle. It may not feel quite as planted as a big western handle when cutting very large or firm items, but for vegetable prep and everyday kitchen work it is noticeably more comfortable. That kind of prep probably makes up most of my time in the kitchen anyway.Visually, this knife looks great too. The blade texture and layered pattern stand out, and the rosewood handle with the brass stud gives it a refined look. It definitely feels and looks different from my western knives in a good way. Overall, this has been a very satisfying switch.",5,POSITIVE,0.9938483834266663
R2C1BFQR9S2VL5,"This knife is a kitchen dream. Sharp, balanced, and the rosewood handle feels classy. Effectiveness? Cuts veggies, meat, and everything in between like a pro. Quality?

It's not super convenient to keep it in the box when not in use. Keep this in mind if you have a standard block you're hoping to store this in.

R3LDXMJJNVGBEA,"I received this knife set as a Christmas gift and initially fell in love. The knives look sleek, feel good in hand, and arrived very sharp. Unfortunately, after just over a week of normal household use, the quality issues became impossible to ignore. Any contact with moisture causes the knives to rust extremely quickly, even with regular washing and drying. Additionally, one of the knives chipped while using the included knife honer, which should not happen with proper steel. These knives are advertised as carbon stainless steel with a stated retail value of $400+, but there is no $400 knife set that should rust or chip under normal use. The set is often “on sale” for around $200, which now feels much closer to its true value—if not still overpriced. I’ve also reached out to customer support via email and have not received a response after over a week. While the knives look great out of the box, the durability and materials do not match the premium branding or price point. Very disappointing overall.",2,NEGATIVE,0.9938899278640747

It felt balanced and secure in my hand, with the Pakkawood handle providing a comfortable, non-slip grip even when my hands were a bit greasy.What really stands out is the Japanese steel.

RU2SVWBU4CU3P,"I’ve been cooking for a long time—mostly grilling and butchering my own meat these days—and I’ve used a lot of knives. I picked up this three-piece Japanese-style set, mostly because I liked the hand-forged look of the high-carbon steel. I’m giving this set five stars because of the sheer cutting performance and feel in my hand. They are a genuinely solid addition to the kitchen arsenal.What I really like is the weight and balance of these tools, especially that large butcher knife. It has a great heft to it, which is exactly what I want when breaking down a pork shoulder or thick cut of beef. The boning knife is agile and holds an edge beautifully. The carbon steel is incredibly sharp right out of the box, and it feels like a real, traditional piece of equipment, not some mass-produced stainless steel that dulls if you look at it wrong. The included honing rod is decent, and so far, a quick run over it keeps the blades razor-sharp.The biggest dislike, and you need to know this upfront, is the maintenance. Because it’s high-carbon steel, it’s not forgiving. If you leave these knives wet for five minutes, they’ll start to show rust spots. I have to make sure they are washed and dried immediately after every single use, or you pay the price. My wife is pretty good about it, but with two kids—my 11 and 13-year-old daughters—it's a constant battle to make sure they don't get tossed in the sink. But really, that's the trade-off for this kind of sharp, tough steel. Given the quality of the blades and how well they perform for breaking down meat and handling heavy-duty kitchen tasks, the value for the money is excellent, even with the required extra care.",5,POSITIVE,0.9997590184211731

The wooden handles are very comfortable to grip, and provide plenty of control over the knives. I haven't experienced any rusting or discoloration from washing the knives. I think they'll last a long time. I will update this review with me long term experience with these knives after some time has passed. These feel extremely premium to me, compared to your average everyday kitchen knives. Definitely the sharpest knives I own right now, that's for sure. 5 stars.

I will definitely be handwashing these to keep their wooden handles looking beautiful. This would make an awesome gift for somebody who loves to cook. It is a good value for the money and I feel like it is a set that I will enjoy for years. It comes in a beautiful box and is padded very nicely.

The design of the blade with a cool wood/epoxy handle is very well done and evenly balanced. It feels great in your hand while chopping and slicing. The addition of high carbon in the stainless steel and the 12 degree edge angle makes the blade very durable and sharp as well as rust resistant. It came out of the box razor sharp. One thing to be aware of is that ""pakkawood"" is not a solid wood species. The handle is made laminating sheets of real wood veneer and then gluing them together with a resin. This actually makes the handle less porous and harder than if it was a solid piece of wood...that's a good thing. Also, be aware that the blade is not a true Damascus steel blade. It is just laser etched with a pattern to look like it. I don't mind as it's still a very quality blade and still looks cool.

The only thing I'm not wild about is how they've etched a pattern into the knife blade. It makes it look like you're trying to fake Damascus steel, but the handle is beautiful enough that it will distract you.

R1OWNRO4QIBTXA,"This serrated bread knife solved a common issue in my kitchen: uneven slices and crushed loaves. The 10-inch blade provides enough length to cut through larger breads in one pass. Homemade loaves with thick crusts are no longer a problem. The knife bites into the crust cleanly and glides through the inside without pulling.The steel feels sturdy and well made. There is a sense of control while slicing, even with firm bread fresh out of the oven. The serrated edge stays aligned and cuts evenly across the entire loaf. That makes portions look uniform, which helps when serving guests.Beyond bread, this knife proved useful for cakes and pastries. When slicing a sponge cake, the blade moves through gently, leaving smooth edges. Frosting stays in place, and crumbs are minimal. This made dessert prep feel calmer and more organized.The handle fits comfortably in hand and feels secure during use. Long prep sessions did not cause discomfort. After slicing, cleanup takes little effort. Crumbs rinse away easily, and the blade looks clean without scrubbing.What stood out most was how dependable the knife felt over time. Each use delivered the same clean cuts, whether working with crusty bread or delicate cake layers. It handled everyday kitchen tasks with consistency and strength.

R28ICBH1OYFRMQ,"INCREDIBLE SET.Let me first start out with, I'm not sure if the block came with a minor scratch or if my wife put it there before I got a chance to inspect in good lighting. I opened it all up in lighting comparable to what you see in my photos and never caught a tiny scratch on the block. The next day with daylight, I noticed it. I don't even care. It's small and maybe I'll color it in with a black paint pen or marker if I care enough. These knives are incredible.So first, like everyone else stated, they're crazy sharp. They're so sharp, my wife doesn't even want to use them. She's a tad clumsy and cut herself on the 12 year old set this replaced. That said, she gave it a shot under my supervision to do some veggie work and she was blown away.The feel and quality of these knives needs to be put in hand to understand. They feel like an artists tool. They got weight to them and a high quality feel. The steel is thicker than my last set and feels stronger. The steel goes from tip to end of handle, FULL TANG. The craftsmanship of the handle and shape of the knives is a beauty. I can't stop putting together dishes just to cut stuff, lol. They feel so good in the hand and just make you want to use them.I finally had a chance to use the ""steak"" knives on a pork dish I put together and it cut through like butter. They're all insanely sharp, so again be careful handling them. I washed all of them right out of the box and didn't realize I nearly sliced my sponge in half when I was done with them.So yeah, I'll just end that I'm more than satisfied with these. Replacing my 12 year old KitchenAid set never felt better. I did a lot of research prior to buying and it was a close call between going German or Japanese (made in Cali), then thought about Hattori Hanzo and how the Bride got her revenge. Japanese steel baby. These do not disappoint and you will not regret the purchase, I promise.EDIT - I want to touch up on folks with the rust problems and possibly put some fears to rest. These are stainless steel. Even the Cybertruck has owners complaining about rust. The best you can do to prevent it is immediately dry them as soon as you wash them and do not let them sit in water. Think about it, if you fear they're just going to rust out of nowhere, you would have potentially received one out of the box covered in rust. That's not how it works. More than likely the folks complaining about rust have either put them in a dish washer (use at your own risk) or let them sit in a pot of water or something and did not immediately dry them.My best advice using these is immediately wash and dry them off as soon as you use them. It's easy enough to accomplish. I see I'm cutting some pork, I pull out the Santoku knife. I use it. I immediately run it under water/soap, grab my cloth hand towel and carefully dry it off, ensuring no water is left on it and put it back in the block. This can probably solve 99% of the rust problems.",5,POSITIVE,0.9723554849624634

This is not uncommon, of little consequence, and the seller does not claim it to be anything other than a Damascus finish. I was very impressed with the packaging of the set, and it would present itself well as a gift. The weight and balance of the set is remarkable, and the sharpness is downright scary. I love the look of the magnetic holder, as it lets you show off the set. The magnet is strong, but the knives release with a simple twist. I’ve owned the set for about six weeks now, and so far, have nothing but good things to say about them. They're still sharp, and zero signs of corrossion. Do be aware that one of the reasons these are so sharp is that, like many fine knives, the bevels are ground to a 17-degree angle, compared to a more typical 20+ degree angle. The steeper the angle, the sharper, but more delicate the edge can be. In the end, it’s a tradeoff, but handle them gently, and I suspect they will serve you well. I intend to report back if this set does not live up to its price point, but so far, I’m impressed.",5,NEGATIVE,0.9964021444320679
