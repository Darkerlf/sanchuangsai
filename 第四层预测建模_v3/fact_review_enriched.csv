In sharpening it with their provided sharpener, gently, small chips happened on the blade.

But I could have just bought a knife sharpener if that's what I actually wanted to happen. I threw away the box this came in so even if I could return it, I can't now. I'm out way too much for one of the worst knives I've ever owned. I'll stick to buying ones that cost way less than this one does and just sharpen them.Original review only after first use:This is definitely better that my cheap knives but definitely not worth paying as much as I did for this. It literally lost how sharp it was half way through cutting a bunch of raw chicken breast for batch cooking. I had to wash it and sharpen it to finish cutting up in chunks. In sharpening it with their provided sharpener, gently, small chips happened on the blade. I'm going to keep it and not return it because it's so better than what I have and really need a better knife.

The knife itself is of good quality - it functions well and as a nakiri should. The handle is well-made and comfortable, the knife is weighted and balanced well to enable good control.

It’s shrink-wrapped so there wasn’t any pre-use - my suspicion is that the chips happened in transit. So, I returned the first one and awaited the second. The chips were far worse in the second. I would have had to grind off way more metal than should ever be expected on a ready-to-use knife. I kept the first one because I got it on a special deal, and the chips were small enough for me to grind out in a few passes on the whetstone.

The etching also makes it look cheap which again is just me being picky. When I put it in my hand it immediately felt unpleasant not only is it very heavy but not very well balanced, it feels like I’m holding it too tight just to keep it from falling out of my hands, I felt the edge and it was fairly sharp but not as good as my personal knives which is to be expected from a factory. After first impressions I did a couple tests chopping an onion, tomato and chicken. The knife did about as well as expected on the chicken but under preformed on chopping the onion and tomato, I count the blade was sharp enough to cut the meat and onions if you were chopping straight down but due to the thickness of the blades well as the etching It tended to get caught up in whatever I was cutting. I also found often my knuckles hitting the cutting board before or during chopping I wish the blade was just a bit wider or the handle was positioned higher to avoid this issue. And finally and in my opinion the most detrimental part to the design was the handle. I found it somewhat uncomfortable for a few different reasons the first being the finish it’s gloss which is good for cleaning but not so good for handling it felt as though it was going to turn or slip in my hand when I was cutting especially when cutting the chicken. The other thing that contributes to the death grip I had on it was the fact it’s slightly too circular.

I gave this as a gift to my dad, and he cut himself twice on these.  Higher end knives like the Zwilling Pro are thicker and tapered to help avoid this injury.

Right out of the box, the quality is obvious. The stainless steel knives look sleek and modern, and the wooden block adds a warm, professional touch that fits perfectly with my kitchen décor. It looks clean and stylish without being too flashy.The knives are well-balanced and feel solid in the hand. I really like the contoured handles—they’re comfortable to grip and make prep work feel easier and smoother. So far, they’ve cut everything with ease, from slicing vegetables to trimming meats. I also love the built-in sharpener in the block. It’s such a smart, space-saving feature that helps keep the blades sharp without needing to buy a separate tool.That said, I ran into one big issue. I accidentally left one of the knives in the sink overnight, and by morning it had rusted significantly. Not only did the blade rust, but it also left a large rust stain in my sink. That was really disappointing, especially since I assumed stainless steel would be more resistant. I now make sure to dry each knife immediately after washing and never leave them wet or in the sink.Overall, this set has been a great upgrade in terms of both looks and performance. Just be cautious about keeping them dry—these definitely require some care.

They are still very usable.The attached photos show the wear and tear as of today (1/8/26), nearly 7 years after purchase - both front and back. The purple chef’s knife is the most used knife in the kitchen, hands down. While there has been definite wearing of the coating within the last year or two, the handles still look like the day I bought them. Everything is tight and there is zero rust (even after sitting in the dishwasher or water for long periods). Tips are still in tact. You can’t possibly ask for better performance from a set of $30 knives. These have outperformed more expensive knives I’ve owned by a mile!I’ve purchased multiple sets as gifts and I’m about to purchase a second set for a new home but my originals 100% still get the job done.

It cost $75.99 when I ordered it.This 8-inch Japanese chef’s knife has become part of my regular kitchen rotation. It replaced a western style chef knife I had been using for more than 40 years, and that says a lot. I was comfortable with my old knife, but this one is clearly an upgrade.Over time I have learned that Japanese style knives just work better for me. The blade profile sits flatter on the cutting board, so there is less rocking from tip to heel when I am prepping food. That flatter feel makes slicing and chopping feel more controlled and natural.The edge was razor sharp right out of the box and only needed a quick pass on a steel before its first use. I used it heavily for slicing, chopping, and general prep during the first week, and after that my old chef’s knife stayed in the drawer. The edge held up very well and only needed light steeling to stay sharp. After about three weeks of regular use, I touched it up on a 2000 grit ceramic whetstone and it was right back to day one sharpness.I also really like the octagonal Japanese style handle. It may not feel quite as planted as a big western handle when cutting very large or firm items, but for vegetable prep and everyday kitchen work it is noticeably more comfortable. That kind of prep probably makes up most of my time in the kitchen anyway.Visually, this knife looks great too. The blade texture and layered pattern stand out, and the rosewood handle with the brass stud gives it a refined look. It definitely feels and looks different from my western knives in a good way. Overall, this has been a very satisfying switch.","This review is for the following item: HOSHANHO 8 Inch Chef Knife, 9 Layers 10CR15MOV High Carbon Steel Kitchen Knife, Japanese Professional Gyuto Chefs Knives with Octagonal Rosewood Handle.

I picked up this three-piece Japanese-style set, mostly because I liked the hand-forged look of the high-carbon steel. I’m giving this set five stars because of the sheer cutting performance and feel in my hand. They are a genuinely solid addition to the kitchen arsenal.What I really like is the weight and balance of these tools, especially that large butcher knife. It has a great heft to it, which is exactly what I want when breaking down a pork shoulder or thick cut of beef. The boning knife is agile and holds an edge beautifully. The carbon steel is incredibly sharp right out of the box, and it feels like a real, traditional piece of equipment, not some mass-produced stainless steel that dulls if you look at it wrong. The included honing rod is decent, and so far, a quick run over it keeps the blades razor-sharp.The biggest dislike, and you need to know this upfront, is the maintenance. Because it’s high-carbon steel, it’s not forgiving. If you leave these knives wet for five minutes, they’ll start to show rust spots. I have to make sure they are washed and dried immediately after every single use, or you pay the price. My wife is pretty good about it, but with two kids—my 11 and 13-year-old daughters—it's a constant battle to make sure they don't get tossed in the sink. But really, that's the trade-off for this kind of sharp, tough steel. Given the quality of the blades and how well they perform for breaking down meat and handling heavy-duty kitchen tasks, the value for the money is excellent, even with the required extra care.","I’ve been cooking for a long time—mostly grilling and butchering my own meat these days—and I’ve used a lot of knives.

I opened it all up in lighting comparable to what you see in my photos and never caught a tiny scratch on the block. The next day with daylight, I noticed it. I don't even care. It's small and maybe I'll color it in with a black paint pen or marker if I care enough. These knives are incredible.So first, like everyone else stated, they're crazy sharp. They're so sharp, my wife doesn't even want to use them. She's a tad clumsy and cut herself on the 12 year old set this replaced. That said, she gave it a shot under my supervision to do some veggie work and she was blown away.The feel and quality of these knives needs to be put in hand to understand. They feel like an artists tool. They got weight to them and a high quality feel. The steel is thicker than my last set and feels stronger. The steel goes from tip to end of handle, FULL TANG. The craftsmanship of the handle and shape of the knives is a beauty. I can't stop putting together dishes just to cut stuff, lol. They feel so good in the hand and just make you want to use them.I finally had a chance to use the ""steak"" knives on a pork dish I put together and it cut through like butter. They're all insanely sharp, so again be careful handling them. I washed all of them right out of the box and didn't realize I nearly sliced my sponge in half when I was done with them.So yeah, I'll just end that I'm more than satisfied with these. Replacing my 12 year old KitchenAid set never felt better. I did a lot of research prior to buying and it was a close call between going German or Japanese (made in Cali), then thought about Hattori Hanzo and how the Bride got her revenge. Japanese steel baby. These do not disappoint and you will not regret the purchase, I promise.EDIT - I want to touch up on folks with the rust problems and possibly put some fears to rest. These are stainless steel. Even the Cybertruck has owners complaining about rust. The best you can do to prevent it is immediately dry them as soon as you wash them and do not let them sit in water. Think about it, if you fear they're just going to rust out of nowhere, you would have potentially received one out of the box covered in rust. That's not how it works. More than likely the folks complaining about rust have either put them in a dish washer (use at your own risk) or let them sit in a pot of water or something and did not immediately dry them.My best advice using these is immediately wash and dry them off as soon as you use them. It's easy enough to accomplish. I see I'm cutting some pork, I pull out the Santoku knife. I use it. I immediately run it under water/soap, grab my cloth hand towel and carefully dry it off, ensuring no water is left on it and put it back in the block. This can probably solve 99% of the rust problems.","INCREDIBLE SET.Let me first start out with, I'm not sure if the block came with a minor scratch or if my wife put it there before I got a chance to inspect in good lighting. I opened it all up in lighting comparable to what you see in my photos and never caught a tiny scratch on the block. The next day with daylight, I noticed it. I don't even care. It's small and maybe I'll color it in with a black paint pen or marker if I care enough. These knives are incredible.So first, like everyone else stated, they're crazy sharp. They're so sharp, my wife doesn't even want to use them. She's a tad clumsy and cut herself on the 12 year old set this replaced. That said, she gave it a shot under my supervision to do some veggie work and she was blown away.The feel and quality of these knives needs to be put in hand to understand. They feel like an artists tool. They got weight to them and a high quality feel. The steel is thicker than my last set and feels stronger. The steel goes from tip to end of handle, FULL TANG. The craftsmanship of the handle and shape of the knives is a beauty. I can't stop putting together dishes just to cut stuff, lol. They feel so good in the hand and just make you want to use them.I finally had a chance to use the ""steak"" knives on a pork dish I put together and it cut through like butter. They're all insanely sharp, so again be careful handling them. I washed all of them right out of the box and didn't realize I nearly sliced my sponge in half when I was done with them.So yeah, I'll just end that I'm more than satisfied with these. Replacing my 12 year old KitchenAid set never felt better. I did a lot of research prior to buying and it was a close call between going German or Japanese (made in Cali), then thought about Hattori Hanzo and how the Bride got her revenge. Japanese steel baby. These do not disappoint and you will not regret the purchase, I promise.EDIT - I want to touch up on folks with the rust problems and possibly put some fears to rest. These are stainless steel. Even the Cybertruck has owners complaining about rust. The best you can do to prevent it is immediately dry them as soon as you wash them and do not let them sit in water. Think about it, if you fear they're just going to rust out of nowhere, you would have potentially received one out of the box covered in rust. That's not how it works. More than likely the folks complaining about rust have either put them in a dish washer (use at your own risk) or let them sit in a pot of water or something and did not immediately dry them.My best advice using these is immediately wash and dry them off as soon as you use them.

Those that included photos were not the set I received, so apparently they sell different versions. To be clear, I’ve included a photo of what I received.The knives have a Damascus steel look to them. Note that this is not actual “pattern welded” Damascus steel, but rather finished (probably laser finished) to give that appearance. This is not uncommon, of little consequence, and the seller does not claim it to be anything other than a Damascus finish. I was very impressed with the packaging of the set, and it would present itself well as a gift. The weight and balance of the set is remarkable, and the sharpness is downright scary. I love the look of the magnetic holder, as it lets you show off the set. The magnet is strong, but the knives release with a simple twist. I’ve owned the set for about six weeks now, and so far, have nothing but good things to say about them. They're still sharp, and zero signs of corrossion. Do be aware that one of the reasons these are so sharp is that, like many fine knives, the bevels are ground to a 17-degree angle, compared to a more typical 20+ degree angle. The steeper the angle, the sharper, but more delicate the edge can be. In the end, it’s a tradeoff, but handle them gently, and I suspect they will serve you well. I intend to report back if this set does not live up to its price point, but so far, I’m impressed.","After looking at some of the other reviews, I was somewhat taken aback.
